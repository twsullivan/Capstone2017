# ls -d */ lists directories only in the current directory (removing any *.sh or *.md files)
# awk allows us to filter the results gained from the ls command
# --posix forces it to use POSIX-compatible mode
# -F " " sets the field separator to a space
# The content inside the single quotes matches the folder name against the regex located between the //
# The regex makes sure that the folder begins with either "IT_" or "Devel_", and if it does, awk will echo it.
# The surrounding () and $() makes sure that the awk output gets transformed into an array that we can use.
